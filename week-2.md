## BCG Experience Curve
Represents tha relationship of cost to number of units produced. It means the cost of item gets cheaper as more product is produced becaue we gain experience and efficiency over time. It suggests to be first and fast in reaching high volume if we are to stay ahead of rivals. Being first and early marke take extreme measure and could be best source of sustainable advantage over competition. The matrix is too simplistic and does not represent the full extent and complexity of running the business.

## The Porter Period

## What can we learn from history
1. Avoid too much attention on external environment, focus on internal operations and capabilities
2. Avoid intensive upfront planning before executing an action, it doesnt have to be complete
3. Accept the fact that good strategy ideas could come from distributed organizations and not just from elite groups
4. Avoid approaches that is process heavy and scripted that is hard to tune to know knowledge
5. Avoid approaches that is very technical and mathematical that leads you to thinking everything is predictable and certain

This can be very rational and objective in front end but wasnt successful in the backend
